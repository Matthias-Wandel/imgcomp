# Imgcomp test configruation file
# Please see docs/config.html for more details on cofiguring Imgcomp

# For Raspberry pi OS 11 (bullseye) or later, you can use legacy camera support, or libcamera
# For frame rate of 1 fps or slower, use libcamera-still
aquire_cmd = libcamera-still -v 0 -n --width 1600 --height 1200 -t 0 --timelapse 800 --quality 75 -o /ramdisk/out%05d.jpg

# higher frame rates can be achieved by using the old raspistill using burst mode.  for Bullseye, to use raspistill, you have
# to enable legacy camera support under interface options using raspi-config.
# aquire_cmd = raspistill -q 10 -ex antishake -n -th none -p 1000,0,600,450 -w 1600 -h 1200 -o /ramdisk/out%05d.jpg -t 0 -tl 1000

# Even higher frame rates can be achieved with libcamera-vidd, but this has several downsides.
# Images are of lower quality, no metadata with the images, and support for this with imgcomp
# sometimes glitches.  legacy raspistill is a much better option.
# Note that libjpeg often pritns "Premature end of JPEG file" while imgcomp is running, as the images appear in the directory
# before they are fully written.  I haven't bothered to work around this as libcamera-vid is not a great option.
