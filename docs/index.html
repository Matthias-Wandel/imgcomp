<h2>What is imgcomp for?</h2>
The program "imgcomp" is for capturing long term motion triggered time-lapse photographs
using a <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/">Raspberry Pi</a> with 
<a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/camera-module/">camera module</a>.
The intended use is unattended monitoring and surveillance.
<p>
Unlike the "motion" package, it is not intended to work like a CCTV camera. 
Imgcomp was inspired by "trail cameras" - the sort that
is left strapped to a tree in the woods to take picture of passing deer and other
wildlife, with the images retrieved at a later time.
I use such cameras but found that the passive infrared motion sensing
would often miss events, especially in winter.  Sometimes
they would even miss a tractor driving past the camera!
<P>
I wrote imgcomp to monitor comings and goings at my rural property when I am
not there.  Unlike trail cameras, it will not miss anything, so long as it's
daylight.  However, it cannot be run on battery, and unlike passive infrared,
it will not trigger in the dark.

<h2>What imgcomp does not do</h2>
<li>Not for battery powered application.  It uses too much power.
<li>Not video centric (if you want video, use motionpi instead)
<li>Does not work with USB web cameras (I have not found a sufficiently
     reliable way to get a series of still frames from webcams)
<li>Is not for people unfamiliar with using Linux from the command line.
<p>
<b>
If you aren't comfortable editing configuration files or running a makefile,
before asking me questions,
get very familiar with linux.  This might take you a few months of study.
There is plenty about learning linux on the internet, please don't ask me
for pointers.  Sorry, I don't have time to teach you</b>

<h2>How imgcomp works</h2>
Imgcomp runs the raspberry pi camera capture program "raspistill" to capture
still jpeg images every second.  With burst mode (-bm option in raspistill),
and camera module version 1, up to 4 images can be captured per second.
Newer camera modules are slower.  Images could potentially come from different
sources.  I have experimented with using a webcam to capture still images, but
didn't find a sufficiently reliable still image capture solution to use with webcams.
My brother uses it with <a href="rtsp_cams.html">images captured from RTSP cameras</a>
<p>
Images are captured to a ram disk (to reduce flash card wear).  Imgcomp reads
the images, and if it detects a change from one image to the next, copies the image
to flash for safe keeping, organized by time and date.  The file date of
the original image is used for the time stamp, so organizing is still correct even
if images are analyzed after the fact.
<p>
Imgcomp will optionally occasionally restart rapsistill if the exposure has changed by too
much because if using burst mode with raspistill (for higher frame rates), 
raspistill will not make exposure adjustments during a sequence.
Raspistill can also stalls and stops taking pictures for unknown reasons.
When imgcomp detects this, it will restart raspistill.
<p>
Imgcomp tries to differentiate between important and unimportant changes.  Imgcomp
looks for localized changes in the image from one image to the next.  Imgcomp also
has the ability to ignore or emphasize specified regions during comparison.
Imgcomp also has a "motion fatigue" feature that makes it ignore changes
in parts of an image that are changing a lot over time.  This feature is used to avoid
triggering too often on things swaying in the wind.

<h2>Obtaining imgcomp and setting it up</h2>
You can clone the imgcomp source tree from github onto your raspberry pi using this command
<p>
&nbsp; <span class="c">git clone https://github.com/Matthias-Wandel/imgcomp</span><p>
<p>

Please see <a href="../setup/setting_up.txt">imgcomp/setup/setting_up.txt</a>
for how to compile and set up imgcomp.  The setup consist of several scripts that
need to be run from the command line.

<h2>How image detection works</h2>
Imgcomp compares successive images.  Before doing detection, the images are 
resized to 1/4 size.  (you can also specify 1/2 or 1/8 scaling, but I have only used
1/4 myself).  Scaling eliminates pixel noise and makes it less sensitive
to very subtle shifts in the image.
<p>
Next, average brightness is computed for both images and normalization (scaling) values
computed for both.  After that, brightness and colour differences are computed for each pixel
of the image.  A histogram of change size is constructed in memory.
<p>
It is assumed a typical change only affects one third of the image, so a difference threshold
is computed from the histogram based on that.  Change magnitudes are computed
based on this threshold.
<p>
After that, the image differences are examined again to find a window of maximum change.
This window is computed from a difference map further reduced by 4x, and the window is
4 pixels in size, corresponding to an actual 64x64 pixel window in the source image.
This windowing technique biases detection to clustered changes, which makes it less sensitive
to distributed changes such as snowflakes, rainfall, or grasses waving in the wind.
<p>
Based on the maximum window found, an overall "difference" value is calculated.  This threshold
is compared to the sensitivity setting.  If the change is above the specified sensitivity
threshold, the difference is considered significant and the image, as well as the one
preceding it are saved.
<p>
Imgcomp occasionally false-triggers if an insect or a bird flies past the camera.
This typically shows up in just one image frame, whereas changes of interest are usually
across several frames.  Use the option "spurious=1" in the imgcomp.conf file
to ignore these spurious changes.
<p>
You can also configure the comparison algorithm to ignore certain parts of the image and be
particularly sensitive to other areas.  For more on that, please see
<b><a href="diffmap.html">Imgcomp detection regions</a></b>

<h2>How to view the images</h2>
Once set up, you can view images by entering your raspberry pi's IP address into a browser
followed by "view.cgi".  For example, if your pi has ip address 192.168.0.111, you would
enter "192.168.0.111/view.cgi" into your browser to browse through the images.  Click
around to expolore how it works.  The web interface for browsing images is
relatively intuitive, and continues to evolve, so documenting what exists is not a priority
at this time.<p>
The lines of characters with "-","=", and "#"
are character graphs indicating how much activity was at any one time.
<p>
Once you have clicked to view an image large, with the bar graph along the bottom, there are
some useful keyboard shortcuts:
<p>
_ (spacebar) to toggle play<br>
<b>b</b> to toggle brightness<br>
<b>e</b> to toggle enlarge<br>
<b>s</b> to save pic<br>
<b>n</b> go to next dir<br>
<b>p</b> go to prev dir<br>
<p>
The "save" image feature in the viewer will save images to /home/pi/images/saved, with
a subdirectory for each month.
<p>
You can also map the pi as a network drive and use image viewing software of your choice to
flip through the images.
