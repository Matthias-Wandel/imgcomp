Setting up imgcomp.
-----------------------------------------------------------
From the default user pi, 
put imgcomp into /home/pi/imgcomp/...
either by git cloning it or by unzipping the archive.

Make sure you can sudo.  Type:
  sudo whoami

You may be prompted for your password.  It sould print "root" afterwards.

Start setting things up:
  cd imgcomp/setup
  ./install-packages
Optionally install additional packages (useful but not necessary)
  ./install-packages-extra


Configure build imgcomp, configure imgcomp, make ramdisk
  cd ~/imgcomp/setup
  ./setup-imgcomp
  
Now try running imgcomp
  cd ~
  imgcomp/imgcomp

After a whole bunch of initialization lines, you should see lines printed
starting with a 6 digit number.  This number is time in HHMMSS
If there is motion, you will see lines that look roughly like this:

        110643  133 (1188, 617) (motion)
        
These images will be saved in the ~/images directory.
        

if you want to have imgcomp automatically start at startup
do the following
  cd ~/imgcomp/setup
  ./setup-imgcomp-autorun

-----------------------------------------------------------
HTML based image viewing:
Configure apache2 and compile the viewing program.
-----------------------------------------------------------
Configure web server and make directories
  cd ~/imgcomp/setup
  ./setup-browsing

Determine your Pi's IP address (I assume you already configured
it to run on your WIFI or plugged it into your LAN)
Type
  ifconfig
  
Your IP address will be under eth0: (for plugged in) or under "wlan0:"
if you are using wifi.  The line looks roughly like this:
        inet 192.168.0.106  netmask 255.255.255.0  broadcast 192.168.0.255
        
In this case, your IP addres would be 192.168.0.106

From a browser on another computer, go to this URL 
    (using your IP address instead of the .106 address)
    http://192.168.0.106/view.cgi

Addigional setup notes (to myself)
-----------------------------------------------------------
Setting up samba manually:
  apt-get install samba
  Add this to the end of /etc/samba/smb.conf:
	[pi]
	comment = picture share
	valid users = pi
	path = /home/pi
	browsable = yes
	read only = no
  create samba user with this command:
	smbpasswd -a pi

Configure auto start and auto cleanup
  Run crontab -e, put the following at the end of the file
	47 10,22 * * * /home/pi/imgcomp/free_up_space
	@reboot imgcomp/imgcomp &

Configure static ip
    sudo vim /etc/dhcpcd.conf


Other useful things to install
    vim          Text editor I like to use.
    jhead        Show exif metadata
    fbi          View images on console.
    jp2a         Display jpeg as ascii
    imagemagick  Needed for video mode mode hack.
    gpac         This installs the untility "mp4box".  Needed for video mode hack.
    cifs utils.  For mounting windows or samba shares as file systems.
                 Example: mount -t cifs -o username=pi,password=mine,dir_mode=0777,file_mode=0777 //192.168.0.10/pi p
