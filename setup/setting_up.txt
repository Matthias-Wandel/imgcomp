-----------------------------------------------------------
Setting up imgcomp.
-----------------------------------------------------------
From the default user (for example, pi), 
put imgcomp into /home/pi/imgcomp/...
either by git cloning it or by unzipping the archive.

Start setting things up:
  cd ~/imgcomp/setup
  sudo ./install-packages
  
Optionally install additional packages (useful but not necessary)
  sudo ./install-packages-extra

Build imgcomp and set it up
  cd ~/imgcomp/setup
  ./setup-imgcomp

Run setup script that needs to be run as root (sets up apache2, makes ramdisk)
  cd ~/imgcomp/setup
  sudo ./setup-imgcomp-root

You also need to make sure your camera module is connected, and enabled.
If you want to use legacy raspistill instead of libcamera-still for image
aquisition, then you need to enable legacy camera support under interfacing
options in raspi-config.  Type "sudo raspi-config" from the console to run
raspi-config.  If you use libcamera-still (the default) you don't need to do
this.  but libcamera-still is limited to about 1 frame per second, whereas
legacy raspistill can capture up to 4 frames per second.

  
Now try running imgcomp
  cd ~
  imgcomp/imgcomp

After a whole bunch of initialization lines, you should see lines printed
starting with a 6 digit number.  This number is time in HHMMSS
If there is motion, you will see lines that look roughly like this:

        110643  133 (1188, 617) (motion)
        
These images will be saved in the ~/images directory.

Determine your Pi's IP address (I assume you already configured
it to run on your WIFI or plugged it into your LAN)
Type
  ifconfig
  
Your IP address will be under eth0: (for plugged in) or under "wlan0:"
if you are using wifi.  The line looks roughly like this:
        inet 192.168.0.106  netmask 255.255.255.0  broadcast 192.168.0.255
        
In this case, your IP addres would be 192.168.0.106

From a browser on the pi, or on another computer, go to this URL 
    (using your IP address instead of the 192.168.0.106 address shown below)
    http://192.168.0.106/view.cgi
