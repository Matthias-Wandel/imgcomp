To do next:
* Flesh out browser.cfg, use for realtime:
    * Redo how holidays are stored
    * Big actagram start and stop times configurable
    * Links to other (pweer) cameras for same time
    * Default brighten on/off setting, use original or scaled by default
    * Thumbnail scale configurable
* showpic.js - mouse hover over temporarily flip to image.
* canvas method based actagrams for actagram and day views, similar to hour view one.
* realtime.html: Show log as it comes in line by line.
* Calculate separate motion fatigues for luma and chroma (to better ignore shadows and trees)
* glitch detection for more than one frame (ignore events that last more than 1 frame)
* Image save rate liminting (raise threshold when too many aquired)
